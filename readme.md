# Static Files Server

## 🎮 About the Project
I created a Node.js-based server that serves static files. The server takes a part of the URL path after `/file/` and returns the corresponding file from the server's file system. This allows you to retrieve specific static files by appending the file path after the `/file/` endpoint.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the server and handling HTTP requests)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For ensuring code quality and consistency  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing server functionality  

## 📌 Features
✅ Serves static files based on the URL path following `/file/`  
✅ Reads files from the server’s file system and returns them to the client  
✅ Allows serving of various static resources like images, text files, and more  

## 🌐 Demo
To run the server, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the server locally. Use the `/file/` endpoint to access static files.
